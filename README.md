# The-automobile-price-and-model-project
A Predictive and precriptive Data Analytics project to query the automobile price and model  Database by using Power BI, Power Query Editor and Advance Excel.

"The Vehicle models and prices" project was a data analytics project done for a logistics and car-renting firm that wanted to have a pool of vehicles and wanted to know the vehicle models and makers to settle for, factoring peculiar automobile indicators like fuel consumption per mileage, fuel type, prices(affordability) among others. I set out to analyze whether there was correlation between price and mileage and if there was, to know what the correlation was. Whether it was a positive linear correlation, a negative linear correlation or non-linear correlation. Also set out to find out the average price of each automobile per model. I got to know after undertaking all 5 steps of ETL process that a negative linear correlation exists between the automobile prices and their corresponding mileages. That is, for every increase in the mileage of an automobile, there was a corresponding decrease in the price of the automobile. How then do we determine the automobile with the best buy? A median price per mileage indicator along with other indices like average price per model were recommended to be used to determine the best buy.
